# 🤠 PolyBot – She's Ready to Go All Night, Boys

**This here bot don't just talk purdy – she puts out fer real.** Soon as you hitch her up on Railway, she'll be slidin' into them 5-minute Up/Down crypto markets (BTC, ETH, SOL) faster'n a greased pig at a county fair.

# Grab ahold an' take 'er home
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PolyBot.git

```

These here are the dials'n switches that make 'er purr:

| `MIN_EV` | `0.015` | Won't get outta bed fer less'n 1.5% edge |

| `POLYGON_PRIVATE_KEY` | - | **REQUIRED**: Yer secret key – guard it like yer moonshine recipe |
| `WALLET_ADDRESS` | - | **REQUIRED**: Where she sends the goods |
| `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` | - | Recommended: makes 'er go faster, real smooth-like |

### 3. Redeploy
Once you done fiddlin' with them knobs, give 'er a good redeploy an' she'll start performin' right quick!

## 🔄 Full Redeemer V89 – Never Leave Money on the Table

**NEW!** The Full Redeemer scans for ALL redeemable positions on-chain, independent of the bot's internal state. This means:

- ✅ **Works after restart** – doesn't "forget" positions like the old auto-redeem
- ✅ **Finds ALL positions** – scans Polymarket Data API for everything you can redeem
- ✅ **Lower balance threshold** – only needs gas money (~$0.08), not the $1.2 trading minimum
- ✅ **Manual trigger** – hit `/api/force_full_redeem` anytime to cash out

### Full Redeemer Settings

| Variable | Default | What She Does |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `FULL_REDEEM_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable background scan every 45s |
| `FULL_REDEEM_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `45` | How often to look for redeemable positions |
| `MIN_REDEEM_BALANCE` | `0.08` | Min USDC needed (just for gas) |
| `REDEEM_GAS_BUFFER_PERCENT` | `30` | Extra gas price buffer |

### How to Use

1. **Enable auto-redeem in Railway:**
   ```
   FULL_REDEEM_ENABLED=true
   ```

2. **Or trigger manually via API:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-bot.railway.app/api/force_full_redeem
   ```

3. **Check status:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-bot.railway.app/api/full_redeemer_status
   ```

## ✅ Pre-Rodeo Checklist (Before She Bucks)

- [ ] `DRY_RUN=false` – no more pretendin', time fer the real thang
- [ ] `AUTO_EXECUTE=true` – let 'er loose
- [ ] `POLYGON_PRIVATE_KEY` – she needs yer private key to get intimate with the blockchain
- [ ] `WALLET_ADDRESS` – so she knows where home is
- [ ] Got USDC loaded up on that Polygon wallet – can't ride without gas money
- [ ] Optional: `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` fer them premium RPCs (she deserves the good stuff)
- [ ] Optional: `FULL_REDEEM_ENABLED=true` – auto-collect winnings
- [ ] Open up `/viz` dashboard an' give 'er a once-over

2. **EdgeEngine v2**: Figures out where the sweet spot is usin' volatility + Z-Score – she's real analytical-like
3. **EV-Check**: Won't spread 'er legs fer just any trade – needs EV > MIN_EV or she ain't interested

## ⚠️ Words of Wisdom from Yer Uncle Jeb

1. **This bot plays with REAL money** when `DRY_RUN=false` – she ain't fakin' it
2. **Keep yer private key locked up tighter'n a bull's backside in fly season** – don't you dare commit it!
3. **Check them logs** – Railway dashboard or `/api/status` will tell ya if she's been naughty
4. **She needs liquidity** – won't touch a market with less'n $200 sloshin' around

## 🛠️ Tinkerin' in the Barn (Local Dev)

```bash
# Git 'er installed
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run them tests – make sure she's in workin' order
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Take 'er fer a test ride (DRY_RUN=true so she don't spend yer money!)
DRY_RUN=true uvicorn polybot.main_fastapi:app --reload
```

## 📝 How She Got Here

- `production-ready`: She finally puts out – real trades, strong 5min filter, proper defaults
- `V89 Full Redeemer`: Independent on-chain position scanner – never forgets yer winnings!

## 🔄 Migrate to polybot2 (Fresh Clone)

If `git clone` is givin' ya trouble (big history, corrupted objects, etc.), you can
start fresh with a brand-new repo called **polybot2** that has all the current files
but none of the old git baggage:

```bash
# From inside the PolyBot directory (or any checkout):
./migrate_to_polybot2.sh            # creates ../polybot2

# Then push to GitHub:
cd ../polybot2
gh repo create polybot2 --private --source=. --push
```

The original PolyBot directory stays untouched.

**May yer positions be long, yer drawdowns be short, an' may she never go down on ya unexpectedly!** 🤠💰🍑
